GENERALIZED PROCRUSTES ANALYSIS TOOLBOX

The Generalized Procrustes Analysis Toolbox offers a ready-to-use matlab interface for aligning shape data.  
The implementation allows the user to test the Stratified approach in its different variants for affine, 
euclidean and similarity transformations. It also includes the classical alternation approach for similarities 
and euclidean transformations. In all cases it is possible to indicate missing data in the shapes.

To install the toolbox just add the directory SGPAv1.0 and its subdirectories to your current path variable.


The main Matlab function to access all methods has the following syntax.

T=gpa(D,V,options)


See gpa.m for more details. 


Example files

experiments/example.m  is an easy example of how to use the gpa function with random data. 

experiments/runexperiments.m allows the user to recreate all experiments showed in the paper with synthetic data.

experiments/exp2DFaceDataset.m allows the user to recreate the results obtained with the 2D Face Dataset.
